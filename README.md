# Chip8

I created this project because I was interested in Rust and emulation, so I created a chip8 emulator in Rust.

# Todo

- [X] Load a rom and split it into the correct parts
- [X] Handle all instructions
- [X] Graphics (with SDL)
- [] Sound
    -> Already implemented the timer, just have to add the frequenz and the playback.

- [ ] Keyboard Input
    -> I know how it's working and implemented the basic concept, just have to fix another bug before 
    adding controls.

- [ ] Tests

- [ ] Make the code pretty. I learned the basics with this project so at the moment it's kinda messy.
